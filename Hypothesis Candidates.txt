List of possible hypotheses:

Search vs Inference:

	"Sudokus involving search are more/less difficult for humans than a computer." no

	"Sudokus involving search are more/less difficult for SAT solvers of class X  than SAT solvers of class Y." no

Snake/Killer Sudoku:
	
	"Snake/Killer Sudoku, i.e. varying the shape of the "boxes" negatively affects human performance solving Sudokus
	but not computer performance." Maybe

Encoding:
	
	"The more powerful/expressive the encoding, the less efficient for SAT solvers." Difficult

Number of givens:

	"Number of steps increases with less givens for well-formed Sudokus but decreases for non-well-formed Sudokus" Obvious

Nested Sudokus:

	"SAT solvers are more efficient at solving nested Sudokus than normal Sudokus." Obvious

Symmetry groups/Equivalence Classes

(Sudokus are essentially the same (equivalent) if they can be derived from one another through certain Sudoku preserving operations
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_of_Sudoku#Enumerating_essentially_different_Sudoku_solutions
http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Summer2009/Mahmood/Symmetry.html)

	"Sudokus belonging to one equivalence class have different difficulties for SAT-solvers." Most probably false
	"Is there a way to reliably identify the simplest Sudoku in one equivalence class?"
	"Transforming a Sudoku before solving can safe computational expense."
	"It pays off computationally to transform a Sudoku to the simplest in its class before solving it."

Redundant constraints

https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/353637/1/sudokutplp.pdf investigate to remove constraints from Sudokus (individually
not generally if I understand correctly). They find that: "Redundant constraints are very often good for the performance of CP systems,
and indeed, all solvers we checked perform much slower (about a factor 2000) with a minimal set of big constraints." In addition,
http://4c.ucc.ie/~hsimonis/sudoku.pdf finds that additional redundant constraints positively affect the efficiency of CP solvers.
The question is, is this also the case for SAT solvers? There is some evidence that points in this direction: 
http://anytime.cs.umass.edu/aimath06/proceedings/P34.pdf finds that an extended encoding (thus containing redundant clauses) leads to
SAT solvers being able to more reliably solve Sudokus without search (using merely inference). http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hjain/papers/sudoku-as-SAT.pdf
finds with respect to that extended encoding: " It is easy to see that the extended encoding which adds redundant clauses to the minimal encoding 
shows the best performance among the three encodings." However, they also find that "TheruntimeofaSATsolverishighlyrelatedtotheinputformulasize,
especially, when the input formula size is in gigabytes." So there is likely a trade-off between better inference due to redundant
clauses and larger input size. Thus a hypothesis to be investigated could be:

	"For low numbers of variables (e.g. 3x3 Sudokus) SAT-performance can be increased by adding redundant constraints. 
	For high numbers of variables (e.g. 81x81 Sudoku) SAT-performance suffers from adding redundant constraints."

A related hypothesis would be:

	"The redundant constraints that lead to the greatest efficiency improvement are the ones that are most often added as clauses during 
	non-chronological backtracking."

E.g.: a modified diplomatic puzzle

Let's say the foreign policy of the country has the following axioms:

P'+Q'
Q'+R'
R+P

In addition the king wants

Q+R

Let's say we split by trying Q. Then the axioms lead to a contradiction. That means, Q' is actually an axiom itself. No matter what the king
or the crown prince or anybody else wants, that will always hold. So it is redundant to check this every time when writing invitations for a 
diplomatic dinner. So it would be good if our algorithm could learn this.


http://4c.ucc.ie/~hsimonis/sudoku.pdf contains some redundant constraints. In addition I have thought of the following:

	For each possible box of 9, at least 6 cells are different.
	For the diagonals, at least 3 cells are different.
	There can be at most 3 diagonal neighbours
	No two neighbouring boxes (non-diagonally) can be the same
	...

I also think there might be very interesting follow up investigations which we should discuss such as:
	
	What's the effect of redundant constrants on SAT solvers with different inference techniques (unit clause, failed literal...)?
	How do redundant constraints and different encodings affect each other (the "extended encoding" in effect puts in redundant constraints e.g.)
	Can we make a learning Sudoku SAT solver that adds valid clauses (i.e. redundant constraints) that are frequently added during backtracking
	to the input to increase performance on other sudokus?

As a data set I would suggest the 50000 minimal sudokus found here: http://staffhome.ecm.uwa.edu.au/~00013890/sudokumin.php
This is also what's used in most of the other papers
