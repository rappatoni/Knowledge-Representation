List of possible hypotheses:

Search vs Inference:

	"Sudokus involving search are more/less difficult for humans than a computer."

	"Sudokus involving search are more/less difficult for SAT solvers of class X  than SAT solvers of class Y."

Snake Sudoku:
	
	"Snake Sudoku, i.e. varying the shape of the "boxes" negatively affects human performance solving Sudokus
	but not computer performance."

Encoding:
	
	"The more powerful/expressive the encoding, the less efficient for SAT solvers."

Number of givens:

	"Number of steps increases with less givens for well-formed Sudokus but decreases for non-well-formed Sudokus"

Nested Sudokus:

	"SAT solvers are more efficient at solving nested Sudokus than normal Sudokus."

Symmetry/Equivalence Classes

(Sudokus are essentially the same (equivalent) if they can be derived from one another through certain Sudoku preserving operations
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_of_Sudoku#Enumerating_essentially_different_Sudoku_solutions)

	"Sudokus belonging to one equivalence class have different difficulties for SAT-solvers."
	"Is there a way to reliably identify the simplest Sudoku in one equivalence class?"
	"It pays off computationally to transform a Sudoku to the simplest in its class before solving it."
