List of possible hypotheses:

Search vs Inference:

	"Sudokus involving search are more/less difficult for humans than a computer." no

	"Sudokus involving search are more/less difficult for SAT solvers of class X  than SAT solvers of class Y." no

Snake/Killer Sudoku:
	
	"Snake/Killer Sudoku, i.e. varying the shape of the "boxes" negatively affects human performance solving Sudokus
	but not computer performance." Maybe

Encoding:
	
	"The more powerful/expressive the encoding, the less efficient for SAT solvers." Difficult

Number of givens:

	"Number of steps increases with less givens for well-formed Sudokus but decreases for non-well-formed Sudokus" Obvious

Nested Sudokus:

	"SAT solvers are more efficient at solving nested Sudokus than normal Sudokus." Obvious

Symmetry groups/Equivalence Classes

(Sudokus are essentially the same (equivalent) if they can be derived from one another through certain Sudoku preserving operations

http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Summer2009/Mahmood/Symmetry.html)

	"Sudokus belonging to one equivalence class have different difficulties for SAT-solvers." Most probably false
	"Is there a way to reliably identify the simplest Sudoku in one equivalence class?"
	"Transforming a Sudoku before solving can safe computational expense."
	"It pays off computationally to transform a Sudoku to the simplest in its class before solving it."
